# Infrastructure Directory

The infrastructure directory contains all the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) components and configuration management tools that support the deployment, scaling, and operation of the FinovaBank platform. This directory serves as the foundation for reliable, reproducible, and secure infrastructure provisioning across all environments.

## Infrastructure Philosophy

The FinovaBank infrastructure follows a "configuration as code" philosophy, where all infrastructure components are defined, versioned, and managed using the same practices applied to application code. This approach ensures consistency across environments, enables automated testing of infrastructure changes, and provides a clear audit trail of infrastructure evolution. The infrastructure is designed with security, scalability, and operational excellence as primary considerations, aligning with financial industry best practices.

The infrastructure components are organized to support a multi-environment deployment strategy, with clear separation between development, testing, staging, and production environments. Each environment is configured with appropriate security controls and resource allocations, while maintaining consistency in the overall architecture.

## Key Components

The ansible subdirectory contains configuration management code that handles the provisioning and configuration of servers, services, and applications. Ansible playbooks define the desired state of various system components, ensuring consistent configuration across all environments. These playbooks cover everything from basic server setup to application deployment and service configuration. Ansible's agentless architecture makes it particularly suitable for managing both cloud and on-premises infrastructure components securely.

The terraform subdirectory houses Infrastructure as Code definitions for cloud resources using HashiCorp Terraform. These definitions create and manage cloud infrastructure components such as virtual networks, compute instances, managed database services, load balancers, and security groups. The Terraform code is structured in modules that can be composed to create complete environments, with variables for environment-specific configurations. This approach enables consistent infrastructure provisioning with minimal manual intervention.

The secrets subdirectory contains tools and configurations for managing sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and encryption keys. This directory implements secure practices for secret management, including encryption, access controls, and integration with external secret management services. The secrets management approach ensures that sensitive information is never stored in plain text in the repository while remaining accessible to authorized systems and processes.

## Infrastructure Workflow

The infrastructure components support a comprehensive workflow that spans the entire lifecycle of infrastructure resources:

Infrastructure changes begin with code modifications in this directory, following the same code review and approval process used for application code. This ensures that infrastructure changes are properly vetted before implementation.

Automated testing validates infrastructure definitions before deployment, catching potential issues early in the development cycle. Tests include syntax validation, security checks, and policy compliance verification.

Continuous integration pipelines apply infrastructure changes in a controlled manner, with appropriate approvals for production changes. The pipelines include steps for planning, validation, and application of changes, with rollback capabilities for failed deployments.

Monitoring and alerting are integrated into the infrastructure to provide visibility into resource utilization, performance, and potential issues. This integration ensures that operations teams have the information needed to maintain system reliability.

## Security Considerations

Security is a fundamental aspect of the infrastructure design, with multiple layers of protection:

Network security is implemented through segmentation, firewalls, and access controls that restrict communication to authorized paths. The network architecture follows the principle of least privilege, with clear separation between public-facing and internal components.

Identity and access management controls ensure that only authorized users and services can access infrastructure resources. Role-based access control is implemented consistently across all infrastructure components.

Encryption is applied to data at rest and in transit, protecting sensitive information throughout its lifecycle. Key management follows industry best practices to ensure the security of encryption keys.

Compliance with financial regulations is built into the infrastructure design, with controls and audit capabilities that meet regulatory requirements. The infrastructure supports comprehensive logging and monitoring for security events.

## Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

The infrastructure includes provisions for disaster recovery and business continuity:

Backup and recovery procedures ensure that data and configuration can be restored in case of failures. Regular backup testing verifies the effectiveness of these procedures.

High availability configurations minimize the impact of component failures on overall system availability. Critical components are deployed with redundancy to eliminate single points of failure.

Geographic distribution of resources provides resilience against regional outages, with the ability to fail over to alternate regions when necessary. The infrastructure supports both active-active and active-passive configurations depending on service requirements.

## Integration with CI/CD Pipeline

The infrastructure components integrate seamlessly with the CI/CD pipeline:

Infrastructure changes can be triggered by application deployments, ensuring that necessary infrastructure updates are applied before new application versions are deployed.

Environment provisioning is automated, allowing the creation of consistent environments for testing and staging. This automation supports the rapid creation of ephemeral environments for feature testing.

Deployment validation includes infrastructure verification steps that confirm the correct state of infrastructure components before and after application deployment.

The infrastructure directory serves as the foundation for reliable, secure, and scalable operation of the FinovaBank platform, enabling consistent deployment and management across all environments.
