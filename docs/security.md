# FinovaBank Security Documentation

## Overview
FinovaBank prioritizes security to ensure that customer data and financial transactions are well protected. This document outlines the various security mechanisms implemented across different layers, including encryption, authentication, authorization, and secret management.

## Encryption

### Data Encryption
- **Algorithm**: **AES-256** is used for encrypting sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- **Key Management**: Encryption keys are managed using **HashiCorp Vault**. Each key is rotated periodically to ensure compliance with security standards.
- **Data at Rest**: Sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII), is encrypted using AES-256 before being stored in databases (PostgreSQL and MongoDB).
- **Data in Transit**: All data transmitted between microservices is encrypted using **TLS 1.2**.

### TLS Certificates
- All external communication uses **TLS 1.2** or higher to secure communication channels.
- **Let's Encrypt** is used to issue certificates for securing communication between clients and the API Gateway.

## Authentication

### OAuth2 Authentication
- **Technology**: **OAuth2** is used to manage user and service authentication.
- **Authorization Server**: The **Authentication & Authorization** server manages access tokens, refresh tokens, and client credentials for secure access.
- **Access Tokens**: Short-lived access tokens are used to validate user sessions, reducing the impact of token theft.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Users are required to verify their identity with a second factor (e.g., OTP via email or SMS) when performing critical actions, such as money transfers or loan approvals.

## Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Roles**: The system uses **RBAC** to enforce user-level permissions:
    - **ROLE_ADMIN**: Has complete control over all services and management.
    - **ROLE_USER**: Can access personal financial data, initiate transactions, and manage savings.
    - **ROLE_AUDITOR**: Read-only access to compliance and transaction records.
- **Permission Evaluation**: Custom **Permission Evaluator** components determine if a user has the required permissions to execute specific actions.

### Scope-Based Authorization
- OAuth2 scopes are used to define access to specific services.
- Each microservice checks for the required scope before serving the request.

## Secret Management

### HashiCorp Vault
- **Vault Integration**: **HashiCorp Vault** is used to store and manage sensitive credentials, including database passwords, OAuth2 client secrets, and encryption keys.
- **Dynamic Secrets**: Vault provides dynamic database credentials that are generated on demand and expire after a specified period.
- **Access Control**: Only authorized services have access to specific secrets through Vault policies.

## Network Security

### Service Mesh Security (Istio)
- **mTLS (Mutual TLS)**: All communication between microservices is encrypted with **mutual TLS** using Istio service mesh, ensuring end-to-end encryption and verifying service identities.
- **Traffic Policies**: Istio enables fine-grained traffic management to prevent unauthorized communication between services.

### API Gateway Security
- **Rate Limiting**: To protect against **DDoS attacks**, the **API Gateway** uses rate-limiting policies.
- **IP Whitelisting**: Critical services like the **Compliance Service** are accessible only from a set of trusted IP addresses.

## Database Security

### PostgreSQL and MongoDB
- **Encryption at Rest**: Both **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB** use disk-level encryption to protect data.
- **Access Control**: Each service has its own database credentials, managed via HashiCorp Vault, ensuring services cannot access each otherâ€™s data.
- **Audit Logs**: All database interactions are logged, and the logs are sent to **Kibana** for monitoring.

## Application Security

### Input Validation
- **Sanitization**: All inputs are sanitized to prevent **SQL Injection** and **XSS** attacks.
- **Validation**: Data validation is performed both at the client and server levels to ensure consistency and accuracy.

### Security Headers
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Enforced to mitigate XSS attacks.
- **X-Frame-Options**: Set to **DENY** to prevent clickjacking.
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Set to **nosniff** to prevent MIME type sniffing.
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**: Forces secure connections to the server.

## Logging and Monitoring

### Audit Logs
- **User Activity Logs**: Logs of user activities, such as login attempts, money transfers, and loan applications, are collected for auditing purposes.
- **Admin Activity Logs**: Actions performed by administrators are logged and reviewed periodically.

### Incident Monitoring
- **Prometheus** is used to monitor key metrics and trigger alerts for suspicious activity, such as a high number of failed login attempts.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: The **ELK Stack** is used for centralized logging and analysis. Log data is monitored for anomalies, and alerts are raised if any unusual patterns are detected.

### Alerts and Notifications
- Alerts are set up for critical security events, such as repeated failed login attempts, unauthorized access attempts, and service failures.
- Notifications are sent to administrators via **email** and **Slack** integrations.

## Vulnerability Management

### Dependency Scanning
- **OWASP Dependency-Check** is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for vulnerabilities in project dependencies.

### Penetration Testing
- Regular **penetration testing** is conducted to identify vulnerabilities in the application.
- Identified vulnerabilities are tracked and remediated in a timely manner.

## Disaster Recovery and Incident Response

### Backups
- **Automated Backups**: Databases are backed up daily, with backups encrypted and stored securely.
- **Recovery Testing**: Regular recovery tests are performed to verify the integrity of the backups.

### Incident Response Plan
- A well-documented **Incident Response Plan** is in place, which includes steps for detecting, reporting, containing, and eradicating security incidents.
- **Incident Response Team**: A designated team is responsible for managing security incidents, including communication with stakeholders.
