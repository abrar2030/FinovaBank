# FinovaBank Architecture Documentation

## Overview
The FinovaBank platform is designed as a microservices-based digital banking solution, providing services like account management, transactions, loan processing, savings goals, risk assessment, compliance, notifications, and reporting. This document details the architecture, component interactions, technologies used, and deployment considerations.

## Core Components

### 1. API Gateway
- **Technology**: Spring Cloud Gateway
- **Purpose**: Acts as a single entry point for all requests, routes traffic to appropriate microservices, handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate-limiting, and logging.

### 2. Service Registry and Discovery
- **Technology**: Eureka
- **Purpose**: Service discovery to locate instances of microservices dynamically, enabling easier scaling and failure recovery.

### 3. Config Server
- **Technology**: Spring Cloud Config
- **Purpose**: Provides centralized configuration management for all microservices.

### 4. Microservices
Each of the following services is implemented using **Spring Boot**:

#### a. Account Management Service
- Handles user account creation, updates, and account status.
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL for relational data.

#### b. Transaction Service
- Manages financial transactions between accounts, including deposits and withdrawals.
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL for transaction records.

#### c. Loan Service
- Handles loan applications, approvals, and repayment tracking.
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL.

#### d. Savings Goals Service
- Allows users to create and track savings goals.
- **Data Storage**: MongoDB.

#### e. Risk Assessment Service
- Evaluates risk factors for loan applications.
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL.

#### f. Compliance Service
- Monitors transactions and account activities for adherence to compliance standards (e.g., AML).
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL.

#### g. Notification Service
- Sends email and SMS notifications related to account activities, loan status, etc.
- **Queueing System**: Kafka for event-driven notifications.

#### h. Reporting Service
- Provides periodic financial reports for users and administrators.
- **Data Storage**: MongoDB for document-oriented reporting data.

## Data Flow and Communication
- **Request Flow**: All client requests pass through the **API Gateway**, which authenticates the user and routes the requests to the appropriate microservice.
- **Service-to-Service Communication**: Most services communicate synchronously using **REST API calls**. Some event-driven communication happens through **Kafka**, especially for notifications and compliance checks.

## Service Mesh
- **Technology**: Istio (running in Kubernetes)
- **Purpose**: Manages communication between services for observability, security (mutual TLS), and traffic management.

## Database
- **Relational Data**: **PostgreSQL** is used for transaction records, account details, loan information, and other structured data.
- **Document-Oriented Data**: **MongoDB** is used to manage document-based data for reporting and savings goals.

## Deployment Architecture
- **Containerization**: All services are containerized using **Docker**.
- **Orchestration**: Services are deployed using **Kubernetes**, with each microservice running in its own pod, managed through **Helm** charts.
- **Load Balancer**: Requests are distributed across multiple instances of the same service using **Kubernetes' LoadBalancer**.

## Security
- **Encryption**: **AES-256** is used for encrypting sensitive data.
- **Authentication**: **OAuth2** is used for securing APIs.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) is applied for determining user permissions.
- **Secrets Management**: **HashiCorp Vault** is used to manage sensitive information like database credentials and API keys.

## Observability
- **Monitoring**: **Prometheus** collects metrics from each service.
- **Dashboards**: **Grafana** is used to visualize metrics and track system health.
- **Logging**: **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) collects and visualizes application logs for debugging and monitoring.

## Scalability and Resilience
- **Auto-Scaling**: **Kubernetes HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)** scales services based on CPU/memory usage.
- **Failover**: Multiple replicas of services are deployed to avoid single points of failure.
- **Load Balancing**: Requests are balanced across multiple instances to ensure high availability.

## Technologies Summary
- **Backend Framework**: Spring Boot
- **API Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway
- **Service Discovery**: Eureka
- **Config Management**: Spring Cloud Config
- **Service Mesh**: Istio
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Messaging**: Kafka
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Secrets Management**: HashiCorp Vault
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
