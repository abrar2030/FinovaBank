# Database Directory

The database directory serves as the central repository for all database-related configurations, migrations, and schemas that support the FinovaBank application. This directory contains essential components for managing both relational and non-relational databases used throughout the banking platform.

## Database Architecture

FinovaBank implements a polyglot persistence strategy, utilizing different database technologies to optimize for specific data access patterns and requirements. The primary databases employed are PostgreSQL for transactional data that requires ACID compliance and MongoDB for flexible, document-oriented storage. This hybrid approach allows the application to leverage the strengths of each database type while maintaining data integrity and performance.

The database architecture is designed with scalability and reliability in mind, supporting horizontal scaling through sharding and replication where appropriate. The separation of database configurations by type facilitates independent management and optimization of each database system according to its specific requirements and usage patterns.

## Directory Structure

The database directory is organized into three main subdirectories:

The migrations subdirectory contains all database schema evolution scripts, following a version-controlled approach to database changes. These migration scripts enable consistent and repeatable database schema updates across all environments, from development to production. Each migration is timestamped and includes both forward (upgrade) and rollback (downgrade) operations to ensure safe deployment and potential reversal if needed.

The postgres subdirectory houses all PostgreSQL-specific configurations, including table definitions, indexes, constraints, and stored procedures. PostgreSQL is primarily used for account data, transactions, and other structured financial information that requires strong consistency and transaction support. The configurations are optimized for financial data integrity and reporting performance.

The mongodb subdirectory contains MongoDB-specific configurations, including collection definitions, indexes, and aggregation pipelines. MongoDB is utilized for flexible data structures such as user preferences, notification settings, and other semi-structured data that benefits from document-oriented storage. The configurations are designed to support efficient querying and scaling of document collections.

## Database Management Practices

The database components follow industry best practices for financial systems, including:

Comprehensive version control of all database changes through migration scripts, ensuring that database evolution is tracked alongside application code changes. This approach prevents drift between environments and provides a clear audit trail of database modifications.

Strong security measures including encryption at rest, column-level encryption for sensitive data, and robust access control mechanisms. Database credentials are managed through secure secret management systems and are never hardcoded in configuration files.

Performance optimization through carefully designed indexes, query optimization, and regular maintenance operations. The database configurations include monitoring hooks that integrate with the application's overall monitoring infrastructure.

Data integrity enforcement through constraints, triggers, and application-level validation to ensure that all financial data remains accurate and consistent. Transactional boundaries are clearly defined to maintain the atomicity of related operations.

Backup and recovery procedures that ensure data durability and business continuity in case of failures. The database configurations support point-in-time recovery capabilities essential for financial systems.

## Integration with Application Services

The database layer integrates seamlessly with the backend microservices through repository patterns and data access objects. Each microservice typically interacts with specific database schemas or collections relevant to its domain, promoting loose coupling and separation of concerns.

Connection pooling and resilience patterns are implemented to ensure efficient use of database resources and graceful handling of temporary database unavailability. The configuration supports read replicas where appropriate to distribute read load and improve query performance.

## Development and Operations

For development purposes, the database configurations support local development environments through Docker containers, allowing developers to work with isolated database instances that mirror the production schema. Database seeding scripts are provided to populate development environments with realistic test data.

In production environments, the database configurations are designed to work with managed database services or self-hosted instances, with appropriate scaling and high-availability settings. Monitoring and alerting are integrated to provide visibility into database performance and health.

The database directory serves as the authoritative source for all database definitions and changes, ensuring consistency across the entire application lifecycle from development to production deployment.
