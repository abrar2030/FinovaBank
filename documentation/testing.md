# FinovaBank Testing Documentation

## Overview
The testing of the FinovaBank platform is comprehensive, encompassing various types of tests such as unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and end-to-end tests. This document provides an overview of the testing framework used, the tools employed, and detailed descriptions of the types of testing executed to ensure a reliable and secure system.

## Testing Types

### 1. Unit Testing
- **Objective**: Verify the functionality of individual components or methods in isolation.
- **Tools Used**: **JUnit** for Java-based unit testing, **Mockito** for mocking dependencies.
- **Coverage Target**: Aim for at least 90% code coverage for all core business logic.
- **Execution**: Unit tests are executed automatically during the build process.

#### Sample Test Case: Account Service
```java
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
public class AccountServiceTests {

    @Autowired
    private AccountService accountService;

    @MockBean
    private AccountRepository accountRepository;

    @Test
    public void testCreateAccount() {
        Account account = new Account("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com");
        Mockito.when(accountRepository.save(account)).thenReturn(account);

        Account created = accountService.createAccount(account);
        assertEquals("John Doe", created.getName());
    }
}
```

### 2. Integration Testing
- **Objective**: Test the interaction between multiple units or components to ensure they work as expected together.
- **Tools Used**: **Spring Boot Test** for setting up a full application context, **Testcontainers** for running real database instances.
- **Scope**: Include database interactions, service-to-service communication, and REST API calls.

#### Sample Integration Test: Transaction Service
```java
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public class TransactionServiceIntegrationTests {

    @Autowired
    private TestRestTemplate restTemplate;

    @Test
    public void testCreateTransaction() {
        TransactionRequest request = new TransactionRequest(1L, 2L, 500.0);
        ResponseEntity<TransactionResponse> response = restTemplate.postForEntity("/transactions", request, TransactionResponse.class);
        assertEquals(HttpStatus.OK, response.getStatusCode());
        assertNotNull(response.getBody().getTransactionId());
    }
}
```

### 3. System Testing
- **Objective**: Validate the complete and fully integrated software product to evaluate its compliance with the requirements.
- **Environment**: System testing is performed in an environment that closely resembles production, including database instances, external services, and third-party integrations.
- **Tools Used**: **Selenium** for UI testing, **Postman** for API testing.

### 4. End-to-End Testing
- **Objective**: Ensure that the entire application flow works as expected, from the user's perspective.
- **Tools Used**: **Cypress** for automated end-to-end UI testing, **RestAssured** for end-to-end API testing.
- **Scope**: Covers scenarios like user sign-up, loan application, fund transfers, and notifications.

#### Sample End-to-End Test Scenario
1. **User Sign-Up**: Verify that a new user can successfully register.
2. **Loan Application**: Apply for a loan and verify approval or rejection based on risk assessment.
3. **Fund Transfer**: Initiate a fund transfer and ensure the balance is updated in both accounts.

### 5. Performance Testing
- **Objective**: Validate the performance characteristics of the system, including response time, reliability, and scalability.
- **Tools Used**: **JMeter** for load testing, **Gatling** for stress testing.
- **Metrics Collected**:
    - **Response Time**: Average and peak response times for key endpoints.
    - **Throughput**: Number of transactions processed per second.
    - **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests under load.

#### Sample Performance Test: Transaction Service
```groovy
import io.gatling.javaapi.core.*;
import io.gatling.javaapi.http.*;

public class TransactionServicePerformanceTest extends Simulation {

    HttpProtocolBuilder httpProtocol = http.baseUrl("http://localhost:8080");

    ScenarioBuilder scn = scenario("Transaction Load Test")
            .exec(http("Create Transaction")
                    .post("/transactions")
                    .body(StringBody("{"fromAccountId": 1, "toAccountId": 2, "amount": 500}"))
                    .asJson()
                    .check(status().is(200)));

    {
        setUp(scn.injectOpen(constantUsersPerSec(10).during(60))).protocols(httpProtocol);
    }
}
```

### 6. Security Testing
- **Objective**: Identify vulnerabilities and ensure that the system is secure against potential attacks.
- **Tools Used**: **OWASP ZAP** for penetration testing, **SonarQube** for static code analysis, **Dependency-Check** for detecting vulnerable libraries.

#### Security Test Checklist
- **SQL Injection**: Ensure all input fields are protected against SQL Injection.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Validate that user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Authentication**: Verify OAuth2 implementation and ensure secure token handling.

### 7. Regression Testing
- **Objective**: Ensure that recent changes have not adversely affected the existing functionality.
- **Tools Used**: **JUnit** and **Selenium** with automated test suites triggered through **CI/CD** pipelines.
- **Scope**: All core functionalities, including account management, transactions, loan processing, and notifications.

### 8. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- **Objective**: Validate the system against business requirements and ensure it meets the end-user needs.
- **Approach**: Business stakeholders are involved in testing the application using predefined acceptance criteria.
- **Environment**: The UAT environment is set up to mirror the production environment as closely as possible.

## Test Execution Strategy

### CI/CD Integration
- **Jenkins/GitHub Actions**: All tests are integrated into the **CI/CD** pipeline, with stages for **Build**, **Unit Test**, **Integration Test**, and **Deployment**.
- **Automated Testing**: On every push to the main branch, the pipeline runs automated tests to catch any issues early.

### Test Reporting
- **JUnit Reports**: Test results are generated in XML format for integration into CI/CD tools.
- **Allure Reports**: Allure is used for generating detailed, visual test reports that include logs, screenshots, and performance metrics.
- **Slack Notifications**: Test results and any failures are automatically posted to the development team's **Slack** channel for immediate attention.

## Test Data Management
- **Data Masking**: Sensitive data in the test environment is masked to protect user privacy.
- **Synthetic Data**: **Testcontainers** and **Faker** are used to generate synthetic test data for unit and integration tests.
- **Backup and Restore**: Test data is backed up and restored before each test execution to maintain consistency.

## Tools Summary
- **Unit Testing**: JUnit, Mockito
- **Integration Testing**: Spring Boot Test, Testcontainers
- **End-to-End Testing**: Cypress, RestAssured
- **Performance Testing**: JMeter, Gatling
- **Security Testing**: OWASP ZAP, SonarQube
- **CI/CD Integration**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions
- **Test Reporting**: Allure, JUnit Reports
