## Architecture

FinovaBank is built using a microservices architecture with services running in Docker containers. Each core banking feature (such as account management, transaction processing, notifications, etc.) has been implemented as an independent microservice.

The following microservices are included:
- **API Gateway**: Handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate services.
- **Account Management**: Manages customer accounts, including balance and account details.
- **Transaction Service**: Processes financial transactions between accounts.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users regarding account activities.
- **User Profile Service**: Manages user profiles and personal details.

## Features

- **Secure Account Management**: Create and manage user accounts with encrypted data storage.
- **Transaction Processing**: Fund transfer between accounts with secure authorization.
- **Notifications**: Alerts for account activity via a dedicated notification service.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated cloud infrastructure setup using Terraform.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing and deployment through GitHub Actions.
- **Monitoring**: Uses Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and visualization.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **Database**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Testing**: Jest

## Installation

To get started with FinovaBank locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/abrar2030/FinovaBank.git
   cd FinovaBank
   ```

2. **Build Docker images** for all services:
   ```sh
   ./docker-build-and-compose.sh
   ```

3. **Start services using Docker Compose**:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the platform**:
   The API Gateway will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

- **API Documentation**: For detailed API endpoints and examples, refer to [API_DOCS.md](documentation/API_DOCS.md).
- **Managing Services**: Run `./manage-services.sh` to start, stop, or restart any of the microservices.
- **Testing**: To run unit tests, execute:
  ```sh
  npm test
  ```

## Infrastructure

The infrastructure of FinovaBank is managed using Terraform scripts, which provision cloud resources on AWS. Kubernetes is used for orchestrating the Docker containers to provide scalability.

- **Deployment**: The Kubernetes manifests are available in the `infrastructure/kubernetes` directory.
- **Monitoring**: The system metrics can be monitored through Prometheus, with dashboards set up in Grafana (`monitoring/grafana`).

## Roadmap

FinovaBank is under active development, and I have several features planned for future releases:

- **Mobile Application**: Develop native mobile apps for iOS and Android to provide users with seamless banking on the go.
- **Advanced Security Features**: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and enhanced fraud detection.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Create an analytics dashboard for users to track spending, saving trends, and other financial insights.
- **Integration with External Payment Providers**: Integrate with popular payment providers like PayPal and Stripe for additional payment options.
- **Support for Multiple Currencies**: Enable users to manage accounts in multiple currencies, facilitating international transactions.
